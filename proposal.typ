In the United States, there seems to be a significant focus on electric cars as
a partial solution to the disaster of internal combustion engine cars. My
research will focus on wether or not this is an effective partial solution to
climate change.

The focus will be on North America, Europe, and China. It will look at carbon
production, resource extraction, and infrastructure impact. It will additionally
look at the impact of legislation and tax credits on the adoption and overall
impact of electric vehicles. The ideal time target to look at would be in the
past 20 years. Key stakeholders include, governments, manufacturers,
advertisers, resource providers, and consumers.

My research strategy going into this will be to search the Purdue databases for
any studies relating to this information. Additionally, analysis of the policies
by select nations may be helpful to understanding the patterns and trends. I may
also look at cultural differences between nations as well. This research will
not look at or determine if and how electric vehicles are functionally different
and will focus on the climate impacts.
