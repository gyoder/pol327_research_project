  abstract = {The growth of the electric vehicles (EVs) use forces a need of verification their emissivity due to the electric power source. The thesis of non-emissivity EV is contested. Based on the average conditions of the Polish generation system and distribution network, real energy demand to charge EVs was calculated. Then the emissions were set and compared to the classic cars with internal combustion engine (ICE) according to Euro standards to check what real emissions are for EV and classic cars. For the averaged cases of the low voltage distribution system it turned out, that charging the electric vehicles from the mains results in higher exhaust gases production than the ICE cars. The energy losses are especially high for rural areas, where distances from the energy source to load are significant. This causes higher emissions than in cases of ICE. However the application of the renewable energy sources (RES) may be a best way to achieve zero-emissivity transportation, both in local scale (home RES supplying EV) and in whole system scale by lowering the average emissions substituting fossil fuels sources.},

    Albrechtowicz conducted a case study on the Green House Gas (GHG) emmissions
      of both Electric Vehicles (EV) and Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles
      (ICE). It focused on Poland in 2022 for its scope and limited the analysis
      to cars of that year. Poland's energy is 80% produced by coal. This study
      showed that at high usage of GHG emitting energy sources can make EVs
      less efficient than ICE vehicles. It also argues that EVs still have less
      measurable benifits like lower polution in cities since the emissions
      happen else where. It also advocates for the improvement of infrastructure
      and residential solar panels in order to make the transmissions more
      efficient.
